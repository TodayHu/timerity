# [fit] Conceptual
# [fit] Model

---

## In WatchKit 1.0 your code *runs* in an extension *on the iPhone*.

^ WatchKit extension and Watch app resources are bundled with your iPhone app (like Today and Sharing extensions and custom keyboards)

---

## In WatchKit 1.0 your code *runs* in an extension *on the iPhone*.

![original](WhatGoesWhere.png)

^ iPhone first

^ then watch

^ then generated images

^ “So the first thing to remember is that you’re writing code that runs on the iPhone. Almost all assets on the watch are put there statically at install time.”

^ The next piece of the conceptual model is that you have a limited set of classes to work with. In fact…

---

## All the WatchKit classes fit on one slide that you can read.

^ [beat]

---

## All the WatchKit classes fit on one slide that you can read.

![original](WatchKitClasses.png)

^ “but I don’t expect you to.”

^ A couple of interface controllers. You’ll have one for each screen in your watch app.

^ One device class that vends a singleton. Can get device size and cache images with this.

^ All the rest are the classes for building your UI that David talks about.

^ “But what are these classes good for if we can’t run code on the watch?”

---

## All the WKInterfaceObjects are proxies for views on the watch.

^ [Quick hand-wavy explanation of the diagram. Details on next slide.]

^ The Apple docs say, “Interface objects are not views. They are proxy objects that communicate wirelessly with the actual views used to implement your UI on Apple Watch.”

^ “So what can you do with these objects? Let’s look at the methods available on WKInterfaceLabel.”

^ setters, not properties!

# Conceptual Model

- In WatchKit 1.0 your code *runs* in an extension *on the iPhone*.

- All the WKInterfaceObjects are proxies for views on the watch.

# [fit] Sample
# [fit] App

^ [Fire up the WatchApp and give a brief demo of using it. Stay away from the code]

^ Note that the code is on github

---

# [fit] Syncing Data
# [fit] with Apple Watch

^ Next I want to talk about syncing data with Apple Watch…

---

# Your watch extension is a separate process from your iPhone app; you just signed up for data syncing.

^ even if you don't have a "cloud-based" application, almost anything interesting is going to have to share data

^ and even if you do have a cloud app…

---

# Watch apps die easily; network operations are right out.[^1]

^ So what can we do? …

---

# What’s a developer to do?

- File coordination? [Nope.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2408/_index.html)
- [App Group entitlement and user defaults](http://www.atomicbird.com/blog/sharing-with-app-extensions)
- [Shared CoreData database](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24641768/accessing-core-data-sql-database-in-ios-8-extension-sharing-data-between-app-an)
- [Darwin Notifications—MMWormhole](http://blog.consumedbycode.com/data-synchronization-with-watchkit/)
- Shared SQLite database
- Seed file & callbacks

^ If we can't use network operations, what are our choices?

^ [Review the issues and choices, but don’t dive into code yet.]

# Cartoon of the Day

^ Before turning to more technical details, it’s probably helpful to understand my state of mind when implementing the code…

# [fit] Syncing Using Seed File & Callbacks 

![original](SeedFileSyncing.png)

^ note that time flows down the page

^ [talk through the steps chronologically]

^ Let’s take a look at this in code. This should also be a good example of debugging WatchKit apps.

^ [See presenter’s script]

---

# Syncing Data with Apple Watch

- Your watch extension is a separate process from your iPhone app; you just signed up for data syncing.
- Watch apps die easily; network operations are right out.

^ summarize

---

# [fit] Debugging Apple Watch Apps

- Run iPhone app, open Watch “external display”
- Launch the WatchKit app from Xcode
- Launch the iPhone app from Springboard
- In debugger, connect to the iPhone app
- Use Console to watch Simulator’s system log
  - `…/data/Library/Logs/system.log`

^ Just a summary of the demo for reference on the steps.

---

# [fit] Challenges

^ I wanted to briefly mention some of the challenges I had implementing the demo app…

---

# You need to provision your Apple Watch and configure (at least) three targets.

![inline](Provisioning.png)

^ Watch UUID in Devices
^ Separate bundle IDs for each target
^ Set the signing identities for each target

---

## WKInterface objects silently ignore commands if their proxied views aren't active.

^ This is especially challenging given that you need to also avoid sending commands more than once.

^ [If OK on time, show code.]

---

## Shared frameworks help encapsulate your data model but require some initial configuration work.
