# [fit] Conceptual
# [fit] Model

## In WatchKit 1.0 your code runs in an extension on the iPhone.

^ WatchKit extension and Watch app resources are bundled with your iPhone app (like Today and Sharing extensions and custom keyboards)

## All the WatchKit classes fit on one slide that you can read.

## All UI elements on the Watch are accessed through proxy objects.

^ setters, not properties!

^ File coordination is a no no: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2408/_index.html
^ 	File coordination may be OK: https://devforums.apple.com/message/1074447#1074447

# Cartoon of the Day

^ Before we jump into code, it's probably helpful to understand my state of mind when writing this…

# [fit] Debugging 
# [fit] Watch 
# [fit] Apps

^ SimPholders2 for finding which simulator is active
^ System Log in Console: show logging
^ Launch iPhone app first to get the simulator rolling.
^ Open Watch display
^ Kill the app
^ Launch the WatchKit app
^ In the simulator, tap the iPhone app
^ In Xcode, connect to the iPhone app (now you can switch between the apps with the drop-down in Xcode’s debug console header
^ Note that log messages don’t seem to appear in the console this way, but breakpoints work. You can open the simulator log file in Console to see the log messages.

---

# [fit] Challenges

^ Send UI commands when the corresponding element is not active doesn't update the UI.
^ Using shared frameworks.
^ Selecting watch menu items crashes the simulator eventually
^ no auto layout (challenge?)
^ notifications while watch app is running?
^
